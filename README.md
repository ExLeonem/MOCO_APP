## Outline


### Scenario description
LED strip should be controlled by raspberry pi. The LED strip simulates the rising sun. The App should controll
the LED strip manually and also turn the rising sun mode on and off. 

 - Lauflicht (Erweiterung)
 - Communication with multiple server instances
 - integration with alarm clock
 - Kalendarintegration (Stundenplan, Google Kalendar, Outlook)


#### Hardware components
- Raspberry Pi (zero)
- LED strip
- Power Supply ???

#### Technologies
- React Native
- Rust

#### Architecture (System/Software)
- Server
- Libraries (Server, GPIO serde, API Calls datetime, )

### Complexity
- Hardware complexity (medium)
- Software complexity (easy-hard)
- 

### Project risks
- No experience with hardware (maybe it doesen't work)
- Non standard way to implement App (less support of lecturer)
- 

### Time plan


### Tasks

- Hardware
    - Requirements
    - List of needed components

- Prototype
    - Hello World functionality (React Native, Rust)
    - Hardware components integrated via breadboard
  
- User Interface

#### Motivation and reason for chosen
